Unity Bricks and Balls Implementation - Test Assignment

A mobile arcade game clone built with Unity featuring classic brick-breaking gameplay mechanics. Players aim and launch balls to destroy brick formations while managing ball trajectories and scoring points.

Key Features:
- Post-game popup system displaying multiplayer options and game-over screens
- Persistent leaderboard with score tracking and ranking
- Swipe-based aiming with trajectory prediction and first reflection visualization
- Modular architecture using Zenject dependency injection
- Signal-driven event system for loose coupling
- State machine for game flow management
- Object pooling for optimized performance
- DTO pattern for data transfer between contexts

Technical Stack: Unity 2022+, Zenject, UniTask, Addressables
Architecture: Clean architecture principles, SOLID design patterns, separation of concerns

The project demonstrates scalable game development practices suitable for commercial mobile game production.
